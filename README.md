# Wownet Customer App
## Background
Wownet Customers currently communicate only through phone calls, emails, or WhatsApp to get more information about services or assistance. This process is inefficient for both us and the customers. Typically, it takes more than 10 minutes to receive help or a response, which is unacceptable in the Wownet industry.

## Project Scope
The objective of this project is to develop the Wownet Customer App that provides customers with more information about services, assistance, and other news related to Wownet. The project will include the following four desired features:

1. Customer Login and Customer Information: Allow customers to log in to the app and view their personal information.
2. Customer Current Services and Billing: Provide customers with details about their current services and billing information.
3. News Portal or Articles: Display news articles or updates related to Wownet services.
4. Wi-Fi Hotspot Finding based on Geo Location: Enable customers to find Wi-Fi hotspots near their current location.
5. Chat Customer: Allow customers to chat with customer support in real-time for immediate assistance.
6. Payment: Provide a secure payment gateway for customers to make payments for services.
7. Dark Mode: Offer a dark mode theme for better readability and reduced eye strain in low-light environments.
8. Fingerprint Biometric: Implement fingerprint biometric authentication for secure and convenient login.
9. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions): Include a section with commonly asked questions and their answers to provide quick assistance to customers.
